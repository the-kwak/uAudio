See the explanation here:

Dejavu can memorize recorded audio by listening to it once and fingerprinting 
it. Then by playing a song and recording microphone input or on disk file, 
Dejavu attempts to match the audio against the fingerprints held in the 
database, returning the song or recording being played.
